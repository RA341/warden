# Warden

Your Media's Bodyguard
Tired of Sonarr/Radarr bringing home strays with weird audio and funky subtitles? Warden's got your back!

Because you deserve better than settling in for movie night, only to discover you are watching "Fast & Furious" 
with Dothraki dubbing and Klingon subtitles.

Wait that actually sounds fun

## What It Does

Warden kicks out media files that don't have the right audio/subtitle combo and 
tells your *arr apps to try again. No complex profiles, no headaches.

## How It Works

1. Listens for new downloads via webhooks
2. Checks if they speak your language
3. Boots the bad ones
4. Tells Sonarr/Radarr to find something better
